                    <span class="project-description">Anabel Egner and Philipp Eckel met while studying architecture at KIT Karlsruhe, Germany. After five years working in renowned offices in Berlin, they decided to move to Santiago de Chile in 2024. 
   <br>Here they founded PHILYBEL - a collaborative practice that explores the production of architecture through multiple approaches, always seeking reinvention and refusing to be confined by style or dogma. 

   <br>   <br>Playful yet strict. Green but never washed. Elegant but raw. <br>Talk less, make more.</span>
