                    <span class="project-description">Anabel Egner (she/her) and Philipp Eckel (he/him) met while studying at KIT Karlsruhe. After five years working in renowned offices in Berlin, they decided to move to Santiago de Chile. As employees, they contributed to projects that received the German Sustainability Award 2024, were finalists for the DAM Preis, and were published in various journals including Arch+.

<br>In 2024, they founded PHILYBEL — a collaborative practice that explores the production of architecture through multiple approaches, always seeking reinvention and refusing to be confined by style or dogma.
                  
                       <br> <br>Playful yet strict. Sustainable but never greenwashed. Every line is worth something. Slick but dirty. Talk less, make more. Every project could be the last — so make it count.</span>
