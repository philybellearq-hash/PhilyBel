                    <span class="project-description">Anabel Egner (she/her) and Philipp Eckel (he/him) met while studying at KIT Karlsruhe. After five years working in renowned offices in Berlin, they decided to move to Santiago de Chile. There, they founded PHILYBEL, a collaborative practice that explores the production of architecture through diverse approaches — always seeking reinvention and refusing to be limited by style or dogma.
                  
                        <br>Playful yet precise. Sustainable but never greenwashed. Every line matters. Slick yet raw. Talk less, make more. Every project could be the last — so make it count.</span>

                        <span class="project-description">Philipp Eckel M.Sc., registered architect at the Architektenkammer Berlin, studied at KIT Karlsruhe and briefly at UPC Barcelona, where he developed a passion for cinema. This led to his 2018 master’s thesis at KIT with Prof. Marc Frohn and Georg Vrachliotis, exploring film theory as a tool for architectural design strategies. From 2018 to 2023, he worked at Hütten und Paläste, contributing to numerous reuse and conversion projects, including U-Halle Mannheim – Phase 1 (BUGA), awarded the Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitspreis 2024, finalist for the DAM Preis 2024, and featured in Arch+ and other publications. In 2024, he co-founded FHAO (Office for Future, Hope and Optimism), which is currently completing the second phase of the U-Halle Mannheim industrial conversion. His broad interest in architecture lies within ecosistemic thinking, the development of design strategies and space.</span>
